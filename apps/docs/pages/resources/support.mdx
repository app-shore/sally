## Best Practices for Reporting Issues

### Include Essential Information

When reporting a bug or issue, please provide:

1. **Environment**
   - Staging or Production
   - API version (e.g., v1)
   - Your organization ID (if applicable)

2. **Request Details**
   - HTTP method and endpoint
   - Request headers (exclude API keys)
   - Request body (sanitize sensitive data)
   - Request timestamp

3. **Response Details**
   - HTTP status code
   - Response body
   - Error message or code
   - Response timestamp

4. **Expected vs Actual Behavior**
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened
   - Steps to reproduce the issue

5. **Additional Context**
   - Frequency of the issue (one-time, intermittent, consistent)
   - Impact on your operations
   - Any workarounds you've tried

### Example Issue Report

```markdown
**Environment:** Production
**API Version:** v1
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-05T14:30:00Z

**Issue:** Route planning request returns 500 error

**Request:**
POST /api/v1/routes/plan
Headers: Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  "stops": [...],
  "driver": {...},
  "vehicle": {...}
}

**Response:**
Status: 500 Internal Server Error
Body: {
  "error": "Internal server error",
  "request_id": "req_abc123"
}

**Expected:** Successfully planned route with optimized stop sequence

**Actual:** 500 error with generic error message

**Frequency:** Intermittent (3 out of 10 requests fail)

**Impact:** Unable to plan routes for 30% of our fleet

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Submit route planning request with 15+ stops
2. Include driver with 8+ hours remaining
3. Error occurs approximately 30% of the time
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** 401 Unauthorized responses

**Solutions:**
- Verify API key is correctly formatted in Authorization header
- Check that API key hasn't been revoked or expired
- Ensure you're using the correct environment (staging vs production)
- Confirm API key has necessary permissions

See [Authentication Guide](/api-reference/authentication) for detailed setup.

### Rate Limiting

**Problem:** 429 Too Many Requests responses

**Solutions:**
- Implement exponential backoff retry logic
- Review your request volume and rate limits
- Consider request batching where applicable
- Contact support to discuss higher limits if needed

### Validation Errors

**Problem:** 400 Bad Request with validation errors

**Solutions:**
- Review the error message for specific field issues
- Consult API reference for required fields and formats
- Validate your request body against the schema
- Check data types and value ranges

### HOS Compliance Issues

**Problem:** Routes planned without proper rest stops

**Solutions:**
- Verify driver HOS data is accurate and up-to-date
- Check that vehicle range and fuel capacity are correct
- Review route parameters (max_drive_time, max_on_duty_time)
- Ensure stop service times are realistic

See [HOS Validation Guide](/getting-started/hos-validation) for details.
