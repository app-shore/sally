# Support

This page explains how to get help with SALLY, report issues, and request new features.

---

## Self-Service Resources

Start with the documentation. Most questions about setup, authentication, route planning, and integrations are covered in these guides:

- [Getting Started](/getting-started) -- Setup instructions and your first route
- [API Reference](/api-reference) -- Endpoint documentation and response formats
- [API Guides](/api-guides) -- Step-by-step walkthroughs for common tasks
- [FAQ](/resources/faq) -- Answers to common questions
- [Glossary](/resources/glossary) -- Trucking and SALLY terminology
- [API Playground](/api-playground) -- Test endpoints interactively with live requests

## Reporting Bugs

Use GitHub Issues for bug reports.

When filing a bug, include:

1. **Environment** -- Staging or production, API version, browser and OS if frontend-related.
2. **Steps to reproduce** -- The exact sequence of actions that triggers the issue.
3. **Request details** -- HTTP method, endpoint, request body (sanitize sensitive data), and headers (exclude API keys).
4. **Response details** -- HTTP status code, response body, and error message.
5. **Expected vs. actual behavior** -- What you expected and what happened instead.
6. **Frequency** -- Whether the issue is consistent, intermittent, or a one-time occurrence.

Clear, reproducible reports are resolved significantly faster.

## Requesting Features

Feature requests are also tracked through GitHub Issues. When submitting a request, describe:

- The use case or problem you are trying to solve.
- How the feature would fit into your workflow.
- Any constraints or requirements (regulatory, performance, compatibility).

The team evaluates feature requests based on business value, technical feasibility, number of requesting customers, and alignment with the product roadmap.

## Security and Vulnerability Reports

If you discover a security vulnerability, report it privately. Do not post security issues publicly on GitHub or social media.

**Contact:** security@sally.appshore.in
Include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability. Allow the team time to investigate and patch before any public disclosure.

Security reports receive a response within 24 hours.
