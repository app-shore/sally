## v0.1.0 -- February 2026 (Current)

Initial development release of the SALLY fleet operations platform.

### Added

- **Multi-tenant architecture** with row-level tenant isolation and role-based access control (SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, OWNER, DISPATCHER, DRIVER).
- **Route planning engine** with TSP stop sequence optimization, segment-by-segment HOS simulation, and feasibility validation. Every route is guaranteed HOS-compliant with zero violations.
- **Automatic rest stop insertion** based on HOS clock analysis. Supports 30-minute breaks, 10-hour full rest, and split sleeper berth provisions.
- **Automatic fuel stop insertion** based on vehicle range and diesel prices along the route via GasBuddy integration.
- **Alert system** with 20 alert types across six categories (HOS Compliance, Route Progress, Driver Behavior, Vehicle State, External Conditions, System). Full alert lifecycle: Active, Acknowledged, Resolved. Supports grouping, deduplication, escalation, and auto-resolution.
- **Continuous monitoring service** that watches active routes and detects 20 trigger types.
- **Dynamic route updates** with automatic re-planning when triggers make the current plan infeasible.
- **Fleet management** for drivers, vehicles, and loads with full CRUD operations.
- **Integration framework** with adapter pattern supporting Samsara (ELD/HOS), McLeod (TMS), Project44 (visibility), GasBuddy (fuel prices), and OpenWeather (weather).
- **Dispatcher dashboard** with real-time alerts, route overview, fleet status, and driver coordination.
- **Driver view** with active route display, next stop information, and status updates. Mobile-optimized.
- **Settings and preferences management** at both tenant and user levels.
- **User invitation system** with email-based onboarding flow.
- **Feature flags system** for controlled rollout of new capabilities.
- **SALLY AI chat interface** for natural language interaction with the platform.
- **Notification system** supporting email, SMS, push, and in-app delivery channels.
- **API key management** with staging (`sk_staging_`) and production (`sk_prod_`) key types.
- **Onboarding flow** for new tenants and users with step-by-step setup.
- **Dark theme** with full support across all UI components. Grayscale-only color palette with semantic color tokens.
- **Responsive design** supporting mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and desktop (1440px) breakpoints.
- **Docker Compose deployment** for local development and staging environments.
- **Nextra documentation site** with getting started guides, API reference, architecture documentation, and interactive API playground.
