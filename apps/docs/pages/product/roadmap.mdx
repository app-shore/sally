## Phase 1: Single-Driver Route Planning (MVP)

**Status:** In progress

**What's built:**
- Route planning engine (TSP + HOS simulation)
- Rest stop insertion (full rest, partial rest, breaks)
- Fuel stop insertion (price-optimized)
- Dynamic updates (4 trigger types)
- Web dashboard (plan routes, monitor routes)
- Authentication with multi-tenancy
- Mock external API integrations (Samsara HOS, fuel prices, weather)
- Static distance/time data

**What's remaining:**
- Connect alert generation to monitoring
- Complete external integration adapters
- Driver portal refinements
- Fleet management CRUD completion

**Goal:** Prove value with 5 pilot drivers.

**Success metrics:**
- 5 pilot carriers (5–20 trucks each)
- 100 routes planned
- Zero HOS violations on planned routes
- 90% driver acceptance rate on optional rest recommendations
- Less than 5 seconds route optimization time (10 stops)

---

## Phase 2: Fleet-Wide Optimization

**Timeline:** 3 months after MVP

**Planned features:**
- Multi-driver assignment (VRP solver with OR-Tools)
- Load matching (which driver gets which load)
- Driver preferences (home time, preferred regions)
- Team driving support
- Real ELD/TMS/Fuel/Weather integrations
- Continuous monitoring service (14 trigger types)
- Alert generation engine
- Live tracking with maps

**Goal:** Scale to 50+ trucks per carrier.

**Success metrics:**
- 10 paying customers (50–100 trucks each)
- 1,000 routes planned per week
- $100K ARR
- 80% renewal rate
- Less than 10 seconds route optimization (fleet-wide, 50 drivers, 200 loads)

---

## Phase 3: Live Data Integration

**Timeline:** 3 months after Phase 2

**Planned features:**
- ELD API integration (auto-populate HOS) — Samsara, KeepTruckin, Omnitracs
- TMS API integration (auto-pull stops) — McLeod, TMW
- Telematics integration (live truck location)
- Google Maps Directions + Traffic API
- Weather API (adjust speeds for conditions)
- Fuel price API (GasBuddy, live prices)

**Goal:** Fully automated route planning with zero manual data entry.

**Success metrics:**
- 50 customers
- 3 ELD integrations
- 2 TMS integrations
- $500K ARR
- 90% driver satisfaction ("makes job easier")

---

## Phase 4: Predictive Intelligence

**Timeline:** 6 months after Phase 3

**Planned features:**
- ML-based ETA prediction (learn from historical data)
- Driver preference learning (personalize rest/fuel recommendations)
- Lane-specific patterns (optimize by familiar routes)
- Demand forecasting (predict dock times)

**Goal:** Self-optimizing system that improves with usage.

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

**Timeline:** Ongoing

**Planned features:**
- Load consolidation (combine partial loads)
- Toll optimization (avoid/minimize tolls)
- Fuel hedging (predict prices, route accordingly)
- Driver fatigue scoring (beyond HOS)
- Appointment negotiation (suggest better time windows)
- AI assistant (voice + text) for dispatchers and drivers

---

## TMS Strategy

SALLY supports two data paths for every entity (drivers, vehicles, loads):

1. **TMS Integration** (auto-sync) — For carriers with TMS APIs (Rose Rocket, Alvys, McLeod)
2. **Manual Entry** — For carriers with no TMS, or TMS without APIs

Both paths feed into the same route planning and monitoring intelligence.

**TMS roadmap:**
- **Phase 0:** Manual entry for drivers, vehicles, loads + load lifecycle
- **Phase 1:** Add invoicing + driver settlements + QuickBooks → SALLY becomes a TMS
- **Phase 2:** IFTA, factoring, load boards, EDI, document management → Full TMS parity
