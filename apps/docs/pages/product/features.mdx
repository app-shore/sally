# Core Features

SALLY's functionality is organized around a conversational AI interface backed by seven core capabilities that work together to provide end-to-end fleet operations intelligence.

---

## SALLY AI -- Conversational Interface

SALLY AI is the primary way users interact with the platform. Rather than navigating dashboards and filling out forms, dispatchers and drivers converse with SALLY in natural language.

**What it does:**
- Accepts natural language requests for route planning, status queries, and fleet management
- Translates requests into the appropriate backend operations (route planning, HOS checks, alert queries)
- Returns results in conversational format with actionable recommendations
- Maintains conversation context across multi-turn interactions

**Example interactions:**

| User | SALLY Response |
|---|---|
| "Plan a route for Martinez, LA to Dallas with stops in Phoenix and El Paso" | Plans the route, optimizes stop order, inserts rest/fuel stops, returns the full plan |
| "Johnson's dock is taking 2 hours longer than expected" | Checks HOS impact, determines if re-plan needed, suggests next steps |
| "Who needs rest in the next 2 hours?" | Queries monitoring layer, surfaces drivers approaching HOS limits |
| "Find cheap diesel near Amarillo" | Queries fuel prices, returns top options with prices and distance |

**Status:** UX built and live. SALLY AI is the initial feature and the core user experience -- all other capabilities are accessed through it.

## 1. Route Planning Engine

The route planner takes a driver, truck, and set of stops, then produces an optimized, HOS-compliant route plan.

**Input:**
- Driver with current HOS status (hours driven, on-duty time, break status)
- Truck with fuel level, MPG, and capacity
- Stops with origin, waypoints, destination, and time windows

**Output:**
- Optimal stop sequence (minimize time or cost)
- Complete route with drive, rest, fuel, and dock segments
- HOS compliance validation
- Feasibility report

**Planning pipeline:**

1. **Stop sequence optimization** — TSP solver (greedy nearest-neighbor + 2-opt) orders stops to minimize total drive time while respecting time windows
2. **HOS simulation** — Walks each segment tracking 11h drive clock, 14h on-duty window, 8h break requirement, and 70h cycle
3. **Rest stop insertion** — When the simulation detects the driver cannot legally complete a segment, it determines the rest type and inserts a rest segment
4. **Fuel stop insertion** — Monitors fuel state and inserts stops when the tank drops below a safe threshold, selecting the cheapest nearby station
5. **Feasibility validation** — Confirms zero HOS violations, all appointments reachable, fuel levels safe throughout

**Performance:** Less than 5 seconds for 10 stops, less than 15 seconds for 20 stops.

**API:** `POST /api/v1/routes/plan` — See [Creating Routes](/api-guides/route-planning/creating-routes) for details.

## 2. HOS Compliance

SALLY enforces FMCSA Hours of Service regulations at every step.

**Rules enforced:**

| Rule | Limit | What Happens |
|---|---|---|
| Drive time | 11 hours | Rest stop inserted when approaching limit |
| On-duty window | 14 hours | Full rest required when window expires |
| Break requirement | 30 min after 8h driving | Break segment inserted |
| Cycle limit | 70 hours / 8 days | Route marked infeasible if exceeded |

**Accuracy:** 100% — zero HOS violations on generated routes.

**Audit trail:** Every decision is logged with the reasoning, including:
- HOS status at each segment
- Legal reasoning for rest recommendations
- Comparison against FMCSA regulations
- Violation warnings (if any)

---

## 3. Intelligent Rest Management

When the route planner detects a driver will run out of hours, it calls the REST Optimization Engine to determine the best rest strategy.

**Rest types:**

| Type | Duration | When Used |
|---|---|---|
| Full rest | 10 hours | Resets all hours (11h drive + 14h duty) |
| Partial rest (sleeper berth) | 7h or 8h | Sleeper berth split provision (7/3 or 8/2) |
| Break | 30 minutes | Required after 8 hours of driving |

**Rest recommendation categories:**

| Category | Confidence | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Mandatory rest | 100% | Route not feasible without rest; cannot decline |
| Opportunistic rest | 60–75% | Route is feasible but marginal; dock time available |
| Dedicated rest stop | 100% | No dock available; truck stop inserted as waypoint |

**Decision factors:**
- Current HOS state (how close to limits?)
- Remaining route demand (how many hours needed?)
- Dock time availability (can leverage forced downtime?)
- Cost (how much extra time to extend rest?)
- Opportunity score (0–100)

**API:** `POST /api/v1/rest/recommend` — Called internally by the route planner.

---

## 4. Fuel Stop Optimization

The fuel optimizer tracks consumption across segments and inserts stops before the tank runs low.

**How it works:**
- Tracks fuel consumption per segment: `distance / MPG`
- Alerts when fuel drops below 25% tank capacity
- Finds stations within 10 miles of the route
- Optimizes for price (cheapest) or time (fastest)
- Prefers truck-friendly stations (Pilot, TA, Loves)

**Example:**

| Segment | Fuel Remaining | Range | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stop A → Stop B (300 mi) | 100 gal (600 mi range) | Sufficient | No stop needed |
| Stop B → Stop C (400 mi) | 50 gal (300 mi range) | Insufficient | Insert fuel stop at mile 150 |

**API:** `POST /api/v1/fuel/find-stops` — Called internally by the route planner.

---

## 5. Continuous Monitoring

The monitoring layer watches all active routes and generates alerts when conditions change. It runs every 60 seconds per active route.

**20 alert types across 6 categories:**

| Category | Alert Types |
|---|---|
| HOS Compliance | Violation, Approaching Limit, Break Required, Cycle Limit, Recap Available, Duty Status Change |
| Route Progress | Missed Appointment, At Risk, Dock Time Exceeded, Route Delay, Route Completed |
| Driver Behavior | Not Moving, Speeding, Unauthorized Stop |
| Vehicle State | Fuel Low, Maintenance Due |
| External Conditions | Weather Alert, Road Closure |
| System | Integration Failure, System Error |

**Alert lifecycle:** Active → Acknowledged → Resolved

**Features:**
- Alert grouping (related alerts under a parent)
- Deduplication (same condition doesn't generate duplicates)
- Escalation (unacknowledged alerts increase in priority)
- Auto-resolution (alerts resolve when conditions clear)

---

## 6. Dynamic Route Updates

When conditions change, SALLY decides whether to re-plan or just update ETAs.

**Trigger types:**

| Trigger | Example | Response |
|---|---|---|
| Dock time change | Dock took 4h instead of 2h | Re-plan if HOS impacted |
| Traffic delay | 45-minute highway closure | Re-plan if delay exceeds 30 min |
| Load added/cancelled | Dispatcher adds urgent stop | Re-sequence remaining stops |
| Driver rest request | Driver wants to rest now | Update HOS, re-plan remaining route |

**Decision logic:**
- **Minor impact** (less than 30 min ETA change) → Update ETAs only
- **Major impact** → Full re-plan through Route Planning Engine
- Every update recorded as a `RoutePlanUpdate` with trigger type, impact summary, and before/after plan versions

**API:** `POST /api/v1/routes/update` — See [Route Updates](/api-guides/route-planning/route-updates) for details.

---

## 7. Automated Alert System

Proactively notifies dispatchers when intervention is needed, reducing reactive fire-fighting.

**Key alert types:**

| Alert | Priority | Trigger | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| DRIVER_NOT_MOVING | HIGH | No movement for 2+ hours during drive segment | Call driver |
| HOS_APPROACHING_LIMIT | MEDIUM | Less than 1h drive time remaining | Monitor; ensure rest stop upcoming |
| HOS_VIOLATION | CRITICAL | Active HOS violation detected | Mandatory rest immediate |
| DOCK_TIME_EXCEEDED | HIGH | Actual dock time exceeds estimate by 1h+ | Re-plan remaining route |
| ROUTE_DELAY | MEDIUM | ETA delay exceeds 30 minutes | Update customer |
| FUEL_LOW | HIGH | Fuel below 20% capacity | Insert fuel stop |
| MISSED_APPOINTMENT | CRITICAL | Driver missed time window | Contact customer, re-plan |

**Alert flow:**
1. Event detected by monitoring layer
2. Alert Engine evaluates severity
3. Alert record created (Active status)
4. Dispatcher notified in-app
5. Dispatcher acknowledges, takes action, resolves

**Key principle:** The system handles routine updates automatically. Dispatchers only intervene when human judgment is needed.
