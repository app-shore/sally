# Vision & Mission

## Vision

Route planning isn't just about shortest distance — it's about HOS compliance, rest timing, fuel costs, and adapting to reality.

Current routing tools assume infinite drive hours, static conditions, and no rest or fuel requirements. **SALLY is built for the reality of trucking, not the fantasy of infinite drive time.**

## Mission

Eliminate the coordination gap between dispatchers and drivers by providing intelligent, HOS-compliant route planning that continuously adapts to real-world conditions.

## Core Insight

Every TMS lets you dispatch loads. Only SALLY plans the route for you.

- Routes are **HOS-aware** — the driver has X hours left, plan around it
- Rest stops are **inserted automatically** — where, when, how long
- Fuel stops are **optimized** — cheapest on route
- Plans **update dynamically** — dock took 4h instead of 2h? Re-plan the remaining route

---

## Target Market

### Primary: Small-to-Mid Carriers (20–100 Trucks)

These carriers are the sweet spot:
- Large enough to need real fleet coordination
- Small enough that dispatchers manually plan routes today
- Currently using basic TMS (Truckbase, Rose Rocket) + ELD (Samsara, Motive)
- Pain points: Manual route planning, no HOS-aware dispatch, constant dispatcher-driver phone calls

### Why This Segment?

No TMS for small carriers combines dispatch operations with intelligent, HOS-aware route planning. The only competitor doing something similar (Trimble) targets enterprise carriers at $1,000+/month. SALLY fills this gap.

## Competitive Positioning

SALLY sits at the intersection of TMS (load management), ELD (HOS tracking), and routing (directions) — solving what none of them solve individually.

| Capability | Truckbase | Rose Rocket | Trimble | **SALLY** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Load/dispatch management | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |
| ELD integration | Yes (30+) | Yes | Yes | **Yes (Samsara)** |
| Public API | No | Yes | Yes | **Yes** |
| **HOS-compliant route planning** | No | No | Yes (enterprise) | **Yes** |
| **Automatic rest stop insertion** | No | No | Partial | **Yes** |
| **Fuel stop optimization** | No | No | No | **Yes** |
| **Continuous monitoring (24/7)** | No | No | Partial | **Yes** |
| **Proactive dispatcher alerts** | No | No | Partial | **Yes** |
| **Dynamic route re-planning** | No | No | Partial | **Yes** |
| Target fleet size | 10–50 | 10–500 | 50–5000 | **20–100** |

### vs TMS (McLeod, TMW)
- **TMS:** Dispatches loads, tracks shipment status
- **SALLY:** Plans routes with HOS compliance, inserts rest/fuel stops, monitors dynamically

### vs ELD (Samsara, KeepTruckin)
- **ELD:** Logs driver hours, enforces compliance reactively
- **SALLY:** Suggests when/where to rest proactively, builds compliance into the route plan

### vs Maps (Google, PC\*Miler)
- **Maps:** Shortest route, assumes infinite drive time
- **SALLY:** HOS-aware routing, inserts rest/fuel stops, handles dynamic updates

**Category-creating, not feature-competing.**

## Value Proposition

### For Dispatchers
- Automated route planning with HOS validation
- Proactive alerts when intervention is needed
- Real-time monitoring of all active routes

### For Drivers
- Clear turn-by-turn guidance with rest/fuel stops inserted
- Automatic plan updates as conditions change
- No more manual HOS calculations

### ROI

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| 1 HOS violation avoided | $1,000–$16,000 fine saved |
| 1 missed appointment avoided | $500 accessorial charge saved |
| 10% fuel savings (optimized stops) | ~$200/month/truck |
| 5% more miles driven (better rest timing) | ~$400/month/truck |

## Compliance Strategy

- **Conservative defaults** — Always err on the side of safety
- **Advisory-first** — Driver has final say (except mandatory rest)
- **Full audit trail** — Every decision logged with reasoning
- **Rule-based** — Transparent logic, no black-box ML (ML comes in Phase 4)

> Make auditors bored.
