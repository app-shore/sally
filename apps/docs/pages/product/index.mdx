# Product Overview

**SALLY** is an intelligent dispatch and driver coordination platform for US trucking fleets. It generates optimized end-to-end route plans, continuously monitors real-world conditions, and simplifies communication between dispatchers and drivers through automated alerts and dynamic route updates.

---

## The Problem

Dispatchers and drivers work in silos. Current tools don't bridge the gap:

**Dispatchers** manually calculate HOS (error-prone), react to problems after they happen, and make constant phone calls for status updates. They can't prevent violations proactively.

**Drivers** get a list of stops but no actual route plan. They manually plan routes in their heads, run out of hours mid-route, miss appointments, and waste fuel at suboptimal stops.

**Current tools fall short:**

| Tool Category | What It Does | What It Doesn't Do |
|---|---|---|
| TMS (McLeod, TMW) | Assigns loads, tracks status | Plan routes, optimize stops |
| ELD (Samsara, Motive) | Logs hours, enforces compliance | Suggest when/where to rest |
| Maps (Google, PC\*Miler) | Shortest route for cars/trucks | Understand HOS, insert rest stops, handle dynamic updates |

The result: dispatchers and drivers work in silos, leading to inefficiency, HOS violations, missed appointments, and wasted fuel.

## The Solution

SALLY is a compliance-first fleet operations platform with a **conversational AI interface** at its core. Instead of clicking through menus and forms, dispatchers and drivers talk to SALLY naturally.

### SALLY AI -- Your Conversational Co-Pilot

SALLY AI is the primary interface for the platform. Dispatchers and drivers interact through natural language conversation:

- **"Plan a route from LA to Chicago for Driver Martinez with 3 stops"** -- SALLY plans the route, optimizes stops, inserts rest and fuel, and presents the result
- **"Driver Johnson is stuck at the dock for 2 extra hours"** -- SALLY re-evaluates the route, checks HOS impact, and suggests adjustments
- **"Show me which drivers are at risk of HOS violations"** -- SALLY queries the monitoring layer and surfaces alerts
- **"What's the cheapest fuel stop near I-40 exit 150?"** -- SALLY checks fuel prices and recommends options

The conversational UI is already built and live. SALLY AI is the initial feature and core experience -- every other capability flows through it.

### Under the Hood

The AI interface is powered by a full fleet operations engine:

1. **Optimizes stop sequence** using TSP/VRP algorithms
2. **Inserts rest stops** where HOS regulations require
3. **Inserts fuel stops** based on range and price
4. **Validates HOS compliance** for the entire route before the driver starts
5. **Monitors and updates dynamically** when conditions change
6. **Alerts dispatchers proactively** when intervention is needed

> SALLY converses. Dispatchers ask, drivers update, and the platform handles the rest.

## How It Works

```
Input: Driver (HOS state) + Truck (fuel, capacity) + Stops (time windows)
                                    ↓
                    TSP Stop Sequence Optimization
                                    ↓
                  HOS Simulation (segment-by-segment)
                                    ↓
            ┌───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┐
            ↓                       ↓                       ↓
     Rest Stop Insertion     Fuel Stop Insertion      Break Insertion
     (when hours low)        (when tank low)          (after 8h driving)
            └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                    ↓
                      Feasibility Validation
                 (HOS compliant? Appointments met?)
                                    ↓
              Output: Optimized, HOS-compliant Route Plan
```

### Example

Given a driver with 6 hours available and 3 stops (A, B, C):

| Segment | Type | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Origin to Stop A | Drive | 2h |
| Stop A dock | Dock | 2h |
| Stop A to Truck Stop X | Drive | 1h |
| **Truck Stop X** | **Rest (inserted)** | **10h** |
| Truck Stop X to Stop B | Drive | 3h |
| Stop B dock | Dock | 1h |
| Stop B to Stop C | Drive | 2h |
| Stop C to Destination | Drive | 1h |

**Total:** 300 miles, 22h (including rest), HOS compliant.

## Who It's For

**Primary users:**
- **Dispatchers / Ops Managers** — Plan routes, monitor progress, receive alerts, manage interventions
- **Drivers** — Follow route plans, view rest/fuel recommendations, receive real-time updates

**Target market:**
- Small-to-mid carriers (20–100 trucks)
- Currently using basic TMS + ELD
- Pain: Manual route planning, no HOS-aware dispatch, constant dispatcher-driver communication
