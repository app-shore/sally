# Alert Types

SALLY generates alerts across five categories. Each category contains specific alert types with defined priority levels and recommended dispatcher actions. This page serves as a complete reference for every alert your fleet may encounter.

## HOS Violation Alerts

Hours of Service alerts fire when a driver is approaching or has exceeded FMCSA regulatory limits. These are among the most critical alerts because HOS violations carry federal penalties.

### HOS_APPROACHING_DRIVE_LIMIT

The driver is nearing the 11-hour driving limit.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `HOS_VIOLATION` |
| **Default Priority** | `HIGH` |
| **Trigger** | Less than 1 hour of drive time remaining |

```json
{
  "id": "alt_hos001",
  "type": "HOS_APPROACHING_DRIVE_LIMIT",
  "category": "HOS_VIOLATION",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "title": "Driver approaching 11-hour drive limit",
  "message": "Mike Johnson (TRK-4821) has 45 minutes of drive time remaining. Current route segment requires 1.2 hours. Route re-plan recommended.",
  "driverId": "drv_a1b2c3d4",
  "routePlanId": "rte_f8e7d6c5",
  "metadata": {
    "currentHoursDriven": 10.25,
    "driveTimeRemaining": 0.75,
    "nextSegmentDriveTime": 1.2,
    "recommendedAction": "PLAN_REST_STOP"
  }
}
```

**Recommended action:** Contact the driver to confirm a safe stopping location. Trigger a route re-plan to insert a rest stop before the limit is reached.

### HOS_APPROACHING_DUTY_LIMIT

The driver is nearing the 14-hour on-duty limit.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `HOS_VIOLATION` |
| **Default Priority** | `HIGH` |
| **Trigger** | Less than 1 hour of on-duty time remaining |

```json
{
  "id": "alt_hos002",
  "type": "HOS_APPROACHING_DUTY_LIMIT",
  "category": "HOS_VIOLATION",
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "title": "Driver approaching 14-hour duty limit",
  "message": "Sarah Chen (TRK-7710) has 50 minutes of on-duty time remaining. A 10-hour off-duty period is required before driving again.",

    "currentOnDutyTime": 13.17,
    "dutyTimeRemaining": 0.83,
    "recommendedAction": "PLAN_FULL_REST"
  }
}
```

**Recommended action:** Ensure the driver can reach a safe location to begin their 10-hour off-duty rest before the 14-hour window closes.

### HOS_BREAK_REQUIRED

The driver must take a 30-minute break per the 8-hour rule.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `HOS_VIOLATION` |
| **Default Priority** | `MEDIUM` |
| **Trigger** | 7.5+ hours since last qualifying break |

    "hoursSinceBreak": 7.5,
    "breakRequiredWithin": 0.5,
    "recommendedAction": "TAKE_30_MIN_BREAK"
  }
}
```

**Recommended action:** Confirm the driver is planning to stop. The next rest area or truck stop along the route should be communicated to the driver.

### HOS_VIOLATION_ACTIVE

A driver has exceeded an HOS limit. This is the most severe HOS alert.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Category** | `HOS_VIOLATION` |
| **Default Priority** | `CRITICAL` |
