# Mock External APIs

SALLY provides mock endpoints for external service integrations during development and testing.

## Available Mock Endpoints

### Mock Samsara HOS Data

Get mock Hours of Service data for a driver:

```bash
GET /api/v1/external/hos/{driver_id}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "driver_id": "DRV001",
    "current_status": "DRIVING",
    "hours_remaining": {
      "drive": 6.5,
      "shift": 9.0,
      "cycle": 45.0
    },
    "last_updated": "2024-02-06T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Mock Fuel Prices

Get mock fuel prices for route planning:

```bash
GET /api/v1/external/fuel-prices?lat=34.0522&lon=-118.2437
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "stations": [
      {
        "name": "Shell Station",
        "location": {
          "lat": 34.0522,
          "lon": -118.2437
        },
        "price_per_gallon": 3.89,
        "distance_miles": 0.5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Mock Weather Data

Get mock weather conditions for route segments:

```bash
GET /api/v1/external/weather?lat=34.0522&lon=-118.2437
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "conditions": "Clear",
    "temperature_f": 72,
    "wind_speed_mph": 8,
    "visibility_miles": 10,
    "forecast": "Sunny throughout the day"
  }
}
```

## Using Mock Data in Development

Mock endpoints are automatically available in the staging environment with `sk_staging_*` API keys.

**Example:**
```javascript
const hosData = await fetch(
  'https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/external/hos/DRV001',
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.SALLY_API_KEY}`
    }
  }
)
```

## Production Integration

In production, these endpoints will integrate with real external services:
- Samsara API for HOS data
- Fuel price APIs (e.g., GasBuddy, OPIS)
- Weather APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI)

## Next Steps

- [API Playground](/api-playground) - Test mock endpoints interactively
- [Route Planning Guide](/api-guides/route-planning) - Learn how external data is used
- [Integration Guides](/api-guides/integrations) - Connect real external services
