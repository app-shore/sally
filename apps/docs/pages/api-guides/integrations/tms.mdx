description: Connect McLeod or Project44 to SALLY for load management and shipment visibility

# TMS Integration

SALLY integrates with Transportation Management Systems (TMS) to sync load data, dispatch assignments, and shipment tracking. Two TMS adapters are available: McLeod for dispatch-oriented workflows and Project44 for visibility and tracking.

## McLeod Integration

McLeod Software is a widely-used TMS in North American trucking. Connecting McLeod to SALLY enables automatic load sync, so dispatchers do not need to create loads manually in both systems.

### What You Get

- **Automatic load creation** -- New loads dispatched in McLeod appear in SALLY automatically
- **Status sync** -- Load status changes in either system are reflected in the other
- **Customer data** -- Customer and facility information syncs for accurate stop planning
- **Dispatch assignments** -- Driver and vehicle assignments flow from McLeod to SALLY

### Setup

#### Step 1: Get McLeod API Credentials

Contact your McLeod account representative to enable API access. You will need:
- API URL (your McLeod instance endpoint)
- API key
- Company ID

#### Step 2: Create the Integration

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/integrations \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vendor": "mcleod",
    "name": "McLeod TMS - Production",
    "config": {
      "apiUrl": "https://your-company.mcleod.com/api",
      "apiKey": "mcleod_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "companyId": "ACME001"
    },
    "syncIntervalMinutes": 30
  }'
```

**JavaScript (fetch):**

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/integrations",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X-API-Key": process.env.SALLY_API_KEY,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      vendor: "mcleod",
      name: "McLeod TMS - Production",
      config: {
        apiUrl: process.env.MCLEOD_API_URL,
        apiKey: process.env.MCLEOD_API_KEY,
        companyId: "ACME001",
      },
      syncIntervalMinutes: 30,
    }),
  }
);

const integration = await response.json();
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "int_m1c2l3d4",
  "vendor": "mcleod",
  "category": "TMS",
  "name": "McLeod TMS - Production",
  "status": "CONFIGURED",
  "syncIntervalMinutes": 30,
  "createdAt": "2026-02-10T10:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Step 3: Test and Activate

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/integrations/int_m1c2l3d4/test \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY"
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "int_m1c2l3d4",
  "testResult": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Successfully connected to McLeod. Found 47 active loads and 23 customers.",
  "details": {
    "activeLoads": 47,
    "customers": 23,
    "drivers": 15,
    "latency": "380ms"
  },
  "testedAt": "2026-02-10T10:01:00Z"
}
```

### Data Mapping

SALLY maps McLeod fields to SALLY load fields:

| McLeod Field | SALLY Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `orderNumber` | `referenceNumber` | Primary load identifier |
| `billTo.name` | `customer` | Billing customer name |
| `stops[0].address` | `originAddress` | First stop = origin |
| `stops[last].address` | `destinationAddress` | Last stop = destination |
| `stops[0].earlyDate` | `scheduledPickup` | Pickup appointment |
| `stops[last].earlyDate` | `scheduledDelivery` | Delivery appointment |
| `totalWeight` | `weight` | In pounds |
| `commodity.description` | `commodity` | Freight description |

## Project44 Integration

Project44 provides advanced shipment visibility and predictive ETAs. Connecting Project44 to SALLY enhances monitoring accuracy with external tracking data.

### What You Get

- **Shipment visibility** -- Real-time tracking from Project44's carrier network
- **Predictive ETAs** -- Machine learning-based ETA predictions
- **Exception alerts** -- Project44's exception events feed into SALLY's alert system
- **Multi-modal tracking** -- Track shipments across truck, rail, and intermodal

### Setup

#### Step 1: Get Project44 API Credentials

Register for API access at [developer.project44.com](https://developer.project44.com). You will need:
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Environment (sandbox or production)

#### Step 2: Create the Integration

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/integrations \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vendor": "project44",
    "name": "Project44 Visibility",
    "config": {
      "clientId": "p44_client_XXXXXXXX",
      "clientSecret": "p44_secret_XXXXXXXX",
      "environment": "production"
    },
    "syncIntervalMinutes": 15
  }'
```

### How Project44 Data Enhances SALLY

When both a TMS integration (McLeod) and visibility integration (Project44) are active, SALLY combines data from both sources:

1. **McLeod** provides load details, dispatch assignments, and appointment times
2. **Project44** provides real-time tracking, predictive ETAs, and exception events
3. **SALLY** uses both to plan optimal routes and generate accurate alerts

For example, if Project44 detects that a carrier is running late, SALLY generates a `LATE_TO_APPOINTMENT` alert before the scheduled time, giving dispatchers time to notify the customer.

## Sync Interval Recommendations

| Vendor | Use Case | Recommended Interval |
|---|---|---|
| McLeod | Active dispatch operations | 15-30 minutes |
| McLeod | Off-hours | 60 minutes |
| Project44 | Active shipment monitoring | 15 minutes |
| Project44 | Low-volume periods | 30 minutes |

## Troubleshooting

### McLeod: "Company not found"

- Verify the `companyId` matches your McLeod company code exactly
- Confirm your API key has access to the specified company

### McLeod: Loads Not Syncing

- Check that loads in McLeod have a status that SALLY recognizes (dispatched, in-transit)
- Completed or voided loads are not synced
- Verify the sync interval -- newly created loads appear after the next sync

### Project44: "Authentication Failed"

- Client credentials may have expired -- generate new ones in the Project44 developer portal
- Verify you are using the correct environment (sandbox vs. production)

### Project44: Missing Tracking Data

- Tracking requires a valid SCAC code or MC number for the carrier
- Some shipment modes may not have real-time tracking available
- Check that the shipment has been tendered and accepted by the carrier
