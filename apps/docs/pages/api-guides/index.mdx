# API Guides

These guides help you integrate SALLY's API into your fleet management systems. Whether you are planning routes, managing drivers and vehicles, or subscribing to real-time alerts, you will find step-by-step instructions and working examples here.

## Base URL

| Environment | Base URL |
|---|---|
| Development | `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/` |
| Staging | `https://staging.sally.appshore.in/api/v1/` |
| Production | `https://your-instance.sally.appshore.in/api/v1/` |

All endpoints documented in these guides are relative to the base URL. For example, `POST /routes/plan` means `POST https://your-instance.sally.appshore.in/api/v1/routes/plan`.

## Authentication

Every request must include a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-instance.sally.appshore.in/api/v1/drivers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"
```

See [Getting Started > Authentication](/getting-started/quickstart) for instructions on obtaining your token.

## Guide Map

| Guide | What You Will Learn |
|---|---|
| [Route Planning](/api-guides/route-planning) | Plan, optimize, and manage routes with full HOS compliance. Create routes, insert rest and fuel stops, update routes dynamically. |
| [Fleet Management](/api-guides/fleet-management) | Manage drivers, vehicles, and loads. Create and update resources, query status, handle assignments. |
| [Alerts and Monitoring](/api-guides/alerts-monitoring) | Subscribe to real-time alerts, handle monitoring events, acknowledge and resolve dispatcher notifications. |
| [Integrations](/api-guides/integrations) | Connect external services -- ELD providers, TMS platforms, fuel price feeds, and weather data sources. |
| [Multi-tenancy](/api-guides/multi-tenancy) | Set up tenants, manage users and roles, configure tenant-specific settings. |

## Response Format

All responses return JSON.

### Successful Responses

Successful requests return the resource or collection directly:

```json
{
  "id": "route_abc123",
  "status": "planned",
  "stops": [ ... ],
  "createdAt": "2026-02-10T14:30:00Z"
}
```

List endpoints return an array with pagination metadata:

```json
{
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 47
  }
}
```

### Error Responses

Errors return a consistent structure:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 422,
  "message": "Validation failed: origin is required",
  "error": "Unprocessable Entity"
}
```

Common status codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `400` | Bad request -- malformed JSON or missing required fields |
| `401` | Unauthorized -- missing or invalid Bearer token |
| `403` | Forbidden -- valid token but insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not found -- resource does not exist |
| `422` | Validation error -- request body failed validation |
| `429` | Rate limited -- too many requests, back off and retry |
| `500` | Server error -- unexpected failure, contact support |

## Pagination

List endpoints accept `page` and `limit` query parameters:

```
GET /api/v1/drivers?page=2&limit=50
```

| Parameter | Default | Maximum | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `page` | `1` | -- | Page number (1-indexed) |
| `limit` | `20` | `100` | Items per page |

## Interactive Testing

Use the [API Playground](/api-playground) to test endpoints directly in your browser with live request and response previews.
