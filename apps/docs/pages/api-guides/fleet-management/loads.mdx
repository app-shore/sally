# Loads API

Loads represent individual shipments in SALLY. Each load has an origin, a destination, scheduled pickup/delivery times, and cargo details. When you plan a route, you assign one or more loads to it, and SALLY sequences the stops optimally while maintaining HOS compliance.

## Load Status Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: Create load
    PENDING --> ASSIGNED: Assign to route
    ASSIGNED --> IN_TRANSIT: Route activated
    IN_TRANSIT --> DELIVERED: Delivery confirmed
    PENDING --> CANCELLED: Cancel load
    ASSIGNED --> CANCELLED: Cancel load
```

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| `PENDING` | Load created, not yet assigned to a route |
| `ASSIGNED` | Load assigned to a route plan |
| `IN_TRANSIT` | Route is active, load is being transported |
| `DELIVERED` | Load has been delivered to the destination |
| `CANCELLED` | Load cancelled before delivery |

## Create a Load

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/loads \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `referenceNumber` | string | Your internal load/shipment reference number |
| `customer` | string | Customer or shipper name |
| `originAddress` | string | Full pickup address |
| `destinationAddress` | string | Full delivery address |

### Optional Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `originCity` | string | Pickup city |
| `originState` | string | Pickup state (two-letter code) |
| `originZip` | string | Pickup ZIP code |
| `originLat` | number | Pickup latitude (improves route accuracy) |
| `originLon` | number | Pickup longitude |
| `destinationCity` | string | Delivery city |
| `destinationState` | string | Delivery state (two-letter code) |
| `destinationZip` | string | Delivery ZIP code |
| `destinationLat` | number | Delivery latitude |
| `destinationLon` | number | Delivery longitude |
| `scheduledPickup` | string (ISO 8601) | Scheduled pickup date and time |
| `scheduledDelivery` | string (ISO 8601) | Scheduled delivery date and time |
| `weight` | number | Total weight in pounds |
| `commodity` | string | Description of freight being hauled |
| `specialInstructions` | string | Notes for the driver |
| `status` | string | Initial status (default: `PENDING`) |

Providing `originLat`/`originLon` and `destinationLat`/`destinationLon` coordinates is strongly recommended. If omitted, SALLY geocodes the addresses, which may add latency to route planning requests.

  "routePlanId": null,
  "createdAt": "2026-02-10T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-02-10T10:30:00Z"
}
```

## Update a Load

Modify load details before the load is in transit:

```bash
curl -X PUT https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/loads/load_q7r8s9t0 \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "scheduledDelivery": "2026-02-11T18:00:00Z",
    "weight": 43500,
    "specialInstructions": "Flatbed required. Secure with chains and binders. Dock 7 at destination."
  }'
```

**JavaScript (fetch):**

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/loads/load_q7r8s9t0",
  {
    method: "PUT",
    headers: {
      "X-API-Key": process.env.SALLY_API_KEY,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      scheduledDelivery: "2026-02-11T18:00:00Z",
      weight: 43500,
      specialInstructions:
        "Flatbed required. Secure with chains and binders. Dock 7 at destination.",
    }),
  }
);

const updated = await response.json();
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "load_q7r8s9t0",
  "referenceNumber": "LD-20260210-003",
  "customer": "Great Lakes Manufacturing",
  "scheduledDelivery": "2026-02-11T18:00:00Z",
  "weight": 43500,
  "specialInstructions": "Flatbed required. Secure with chains and binders. Dock 7 at destination.",
  "status": "PENDING",
  "updatedAt": "2026-02-10T11:00:00Z"
}
```

If a load is already `ASSIGNED` to a route and you change delivery times or addresses, SALLY's monitoring service will detect the change and trigger a route re-plan automatically.

## Delete (Cancel) a Load

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/loads/load_q7r8s9t0 \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY"
```

**JavaScript (fetch):**

```javascript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/loads/load_q7r8s9t0",
  {
    method: "DELETE",
    headers: { "X-API-Key": process.env.SALLY_API_KEY },
  }
);
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "load_q7r8s9t0",
  "referenceNumber": "LD-20260210-003",
  "status": "CANCELLED",
  "cancelledAt": "2026-02-10T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Cancelling a load that is part of an active route triggers an alert to the dispatcher and may require a route re-plan.

## Load Assignment to Route Plans

Loads are assigned to routes when you include their IDs in the route planning request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/routes/plan \
  -H "X-API-Key: $SALLY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driverId": "drv_a1b2c3d4",
    "vehicleId": "veh_e5f6g7h8",
    "loadIds": ["load_i9j0k1l2", "load_m3n4o5p6"],
    "stops": [...],
    "optimizationPriority": "balance"
  }'
```

When a route is planned:
- Each load's status changes from `PENDING` to `ASSIGNED`
- The `routePlanId` field is populated on the load record
- The load's origin and destination become stops in the route

When the route is activated:
- Each load's status changes from `ASSIGNED` to `IN_TRANSIT`

When the driver confirms delivery at a stop:
- The corresponding load's status changes from `IN_TRANSIT` to `DELIVERED`
