# Developer Guide

Welcome to the SALLY developer guide. This section covers everything you need to go from cloning the repository to shipping features on the SALLY fleet operations platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

| Tool | Minimum Version | Check Command |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| Node.js | 20.0.0 | `node -v` |
| pnpm | 9.0.0 | `pnpm -v` |
| Docker Desktop | Latest | `docker --version` |
| Git | Latest | `git --version` |

**Optional (for full authentication):**
- A Firebase project with Authentication enabled
- Google Maps API key (for distance calculations)

## Reading Order

Work through these guides in order. You should be set up and running in about 15 minutes, and understand the codebase within an hour.

### 1. [Environment Setup](/developer-guide/environment-setup)
Clone the repo, install dependencies, start infrastructure, and verify everything works. This is where you start.

### 2. [Project Structure](/developer-guide/project-structure)
Understand the monorepo layout -- where code lives, how apps relate to each other, and where to put new code.

### 3. Architecture (Backend + Frontend)
Understand the design patterns before writing code:
- [Backend Module Structure](/developer-guide/backend/module-structure) -- NestJS domains, guards, decorators
- [Database and Prisma](/developer-guide/backend/database-prisma) -- Schema, migrations, seeding
- [App Router Guide](/developer-guide/frontend/app-router) -- Next.js 15 routing and layouts
- [Feature Modules](/developer-guide/frontend/feature-modules) -- Frontend domain organization

### 4. Development Guides
Pick the guides relevant to your focus area:

**Backend:**
- [Adding an Endpoint](/developer-guide/backend/adding-endpoint) -- Step-by-step tutorial
- [Testing](/developer-guide/backend/testing) -- Jest, Supertest, E2E tests

**Frontend:**
- [UI Standards](/developer-guide/frontend/ui-standards) -- Dark theme, Shadcn/ui, responsive design (mandatory reading)
- [State Management](/developer-guide/frontend/state-management) -- Zustand + React Query patterns

### 5. [Common Tasks](/developer-guide/common-tasks)
Quick recipes for everyday operations: adding endpoints, pages, database tables, running migrations, and more.
