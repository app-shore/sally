# Architecture Decision Records

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture the key technical decisions made during the design and development of SALLY. Each record documents the context that motivated a decision, the decision itself, and the consequences -- what became easier and what became harder as a result.

ADRs serve as a historical record for the engineering team. When someone asks "why did we choose X over Y?", the answer is in the ADR.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:

- **Status** -- Whether the decision is Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded.
- **Context** -- The problem or situation that motivated the decision.
- **Decision** -- What was decided and why.
- **Consequences** -- The trade-offs: what became easier and what became harder.

New ADRs are numbered sequentially. Once accepted, an ADR is not modified unless it is superseded by a later decision, in which case the original ADR is updated with a link to its replacement.
