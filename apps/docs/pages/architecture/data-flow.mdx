# Data Flow

Understand how data moves through SALLY's system, from user input to database storage to final output.

## Coming Soon

This section will include:

- **Request-Response Cycle** - Complete flow from browser to database and back
- **Route Planning Flow** - How route planning requests are processed
- **Monitoring Flow** - How the monitoring service detects and handles triggers
- **Alert Generation Flow** - How alerts are created and delivered
- **Update Flow** - How dynamic route updates propagate through the system
- **Data Transformations** - How data is validated, processed, and stored
- **Caching Layers** - Where data is cached and why
- **State Synchronization** - How frontend and backend stay in sync

## Quick Reference

For a high-level overview of data flow, see the [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview#how-the-layers-work-together).

### Data Flow Diagrams

The following diagrams are available in `.docs/technical/architecture/`:

- **Data Flow Diagram** - `data-flow-diagram.puml` - Complete data flow visualization
- **Sequence Diagram** - `sequence-rest-optimization.puml` - End-to-end request flow
- **Deployment Diagram** - `deployment-diagram.puml` - How containers communicate

### How to View Diagrams

1. **Online:** Visit [PlantUML Web Server](http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/) and paste diagram contents
2. **VS Code:** Install PlantUML extension, open `.puml` file, press `Alt + D`
3. **CLI:** Run `./render-diagrams.sh` in `.docs/technical/architecture/`

## Example Flows

### Route Planning Flow

```
User Input (Dashboard) → Validation (Zod) → API Call (React Query)
  → FastAPI Router → Service Layer → HOS Validation
  → Route Optimization → Database Storage → Response
  → State Update (Zustand) → UI Rendering
```

### Monitoring Flow

```
Background Service (60s loop) → Check Active Routes
  → Detect Trigger → Evaluate Impact → Generate Alert
  → Notify Dispatcher → Store in Database → Update Dashboard
```

### Dynamic Update Flow

```
Trigger Detected → Impact Analysis → Decision (Re-plan vs Update)
  → Route Planning Engine (if needed) → Database Update
  → Driver Notification → Dispatcher Notification → Audit Log
```
