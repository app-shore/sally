# Contributing to SALLY

Thank you for your interest in contributing to SALLY. Whether you are fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or writing tests, your work helps build a better fleet operations platform for the entire trucking industry.

This guide walks you through what you need to know before opening your first pull request.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have completed the following:

1. **Set up your development environment** -- Follow the [Environment Setup](/developer-guide/environment-setup) guide to get the monorepo running locally.
2. **Understand the project structure** -- Review [Project Structure](/developer-guide/project-structure) so you know where code lives and how the packages relate to each other.
3. **Read the architecture overview** -- Skim the [Architecture](/developer-guide/architecture) section to understand the three-layer system (route planning, monitoring, dynamic updates).

## What We Welcome

We accept contributions in the following areas:

- **Bug fixes** -- Reproduce the issue, write a failing test, then fix it.
- **New features** -- Coordinate with the team first by opening an issue or discussion before starting large features.
- **Documentation** -- Improvements to these docs, inline code comments, or README files in app directories.
- **Tests** -- Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are always welcome.
- **Refactoring** -- Improvements to code clarity, performance, or maintainability.

## Contribution Checklist

Every contribution should follow these steps:

1. **Set up your environment** -- Clone the repo, install dependencies, start services. See [Environment Setup](/developer-guide/environment-setup).
2. **Create a feature branch** -- Branch from `main` using the naming conventions in [Git Workflow](/contributing/git-workflow).
3. **Make your changes** -- Follow the conventions in [Code Standards](/contributing/code-standards).
4. **Write or update tests** -- Cover your changes with appropriate tests. Do not reduce existing coverage.
5. **Verify UI compliance** (for frontend changes):
   - Dark theme works correctly -- no hardcoded light-only colors.
   - Responsive layout works at 375px, 768px, and 1440px.
   - All interactive elements use Shadcn/ui components (never plain HTML `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`).
6. **Submit a pull request** -- Follow the [Pull Request Guide](/contributing/pull-requests) for the expected format and review process.
