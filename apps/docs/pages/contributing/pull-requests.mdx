# Pull Request Guide

Every change to SALLY goes through a pull request. This page covers how to write a good PR, what reviewers look for, and how the merge process works.

## Creating a Pull Request

### Title

Use the same format as commit messages:

```
type: short description
```

Examples:

```
feat: add driver deactivation endpoint
fix: resolve HOS calculation overflow
docs: add contributing guide
```

### Description

Use the following template for your PR description. Fill in every section that applies.

````markdown
## What
Brief description of what changed and why.

## How
Technical approach taken.

## Testing
How you tested these changes.

## Screenshots (for UI changes)
Show both light and dark theme. Show mobile and desktop.

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Dark theme verified (for UI changes)
- [ ] Responsive design verified (for UI changes)
- [ ] Shadcn components used (no plain HTML for interactive elements)
- [ ] API docs updated (for backend changes)
- [ ] No console.log statements
````

### Tips for a Good PR

- **Keep PRs focused.** One PR should address one concern. If you find yourself fixing an unrelated bug while working on a feature, open a separate PR for the bug fix.
- **Write the "What" section for someone who has no context.** Assume the reviewer has not read the issue or Slack thread. Link to the relevant issue if one exists.
- **Include before/after screenshots** for any visual change. Reviewers should not have to check out your branch just to see what changed.
- **Call out risks or trade-offs** in the description. If you chose approach A over approach B, briefly explain why.

## Review Process

### Requirements

- **At least one approval** is required before merging.
- All CI checks must pass (lint, type check, tests).

### What Reviewers Check

Reviewers evaluate PRs against these criteria:

| Area | What to look for |
|---|---|
| **Correctness** | Does the code do what the PR says it does? Are edge cases handled? |
| **Conventions** | Does it follow [Code Standards](/contributing/code-standards)? Naming, file structure, import order? |
| **Dark theme** | No hardcoded light-only colors? Semantic tokens used? (UI changes) |
| **Responsive design** | Works at 375px, 768px, and 1440px? (UI changes) |
| **Shadcn components** | No plain HTML `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`? (UI changes) |
| **Test coverage** | Are new code paths covered? Do existing tests still pass? |
| **Performance** | Any unnecessary re-renders, N+1 queries, or missing indexes? |
| **Security** | No secrets in code, proper auth checks, input validation? |

### Responding to Feedback

- Address every comment. If you disagree, explain your reasoning rather than ignoring the comment.
- Push new commits to your branch -- do not force-push unless the reviewer requests a rebase.
- Mark conversations as resolved once you have addressed them.
- Re-request review after addressing all feedback.

---

## Merging

- Use **squash merge** to keep `main` history clean.
- Make sure the squash commit message follows the `type: description` format.
- After merging, delete your feature branch. GitHub can be configured to do this automatically.

---

## After Merge

- Verify that CI/CD completes successfully on `main`.
- If your change affects the API, confirm that the docs site and API Playground reflect the update.
- If your change affects deployment configuration, verify the staging environment is healthy.
