# Introduction

SALLY provides REST APIs for intelligent fleet operations with HOS-compliant route planning.

## What You Can Build

With SALLY APIs, you can:

- **Route Planning Applications** - Build custom dispatching tools with HOS compliance built-in
- **Fleet Management Dashboards** - Monitor routes and receive proactive alerts
- **Mobile Driver Apps** - Provide drivers with optimized routes and rest recommendations
- **TMS Integrations** - Connect your existing TMS with intelligent route planning
- **Analytics Platforms** - Analyze fleet performance and compliance metrics

## Core Capabilities

### Route Planning
Generate optimized routes that respect HOS regulations, automatically insert rest stops, and optimize fuel stops based on price.

### Continuous Monitoring
SALLY monitors active routes 24/7 and detects 14 different trigger types that may require dispatcher intervention.

### Dynamic Updates
Routes automatically update when conditions change - dock delays, traffic, driver rest requests, etc.

### Compliance Validation
Every route is validated for HOS compliance before the driver starts, preventing violations proactively.

## API Architecture

SALLY APIs follow RESTful conventions:
- JSON request/response format
- Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Consistent error handling
- Bearer token authentication (API keys)

## Rate Limits

- **Staging keys**: 1,000 requests/hour
- **Production keys**: Coming soon
