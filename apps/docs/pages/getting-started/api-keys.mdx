# API Keys Setup

Learn how to generate, use, and manage your SALLY API keys.

## Generating an API Key

1. **Sign in** to your SALLY dashboard at [sally.appshore.in](https://sally.appshore.in)

2. **Navigate** to Dashboard → API Keys

3. **Click** "Generate API Key" button

4. **Name your key** (e.g., "Production Server", "Testing Environment")

5. **Copy the key** - You'll only see it once!

  <div className="flex gap-3">
    <div className="text-yellow-500 dark:text-yellow-400">⚠️</div>
    <div>
      <strong>Security Warning:</strong> API keys are shown only once during creation.
      Store them securely in a password manager or environment variables.

## Key Types

### Staging Keys

- Prefix: `sk_staging_`
- Environment: Staging API
- Data: Mock/test data
- Rate Limit: 1,000 requests/hour
- Use for: Development and testing

### Production Keys (Coming Soon)

- Prefix: `sk_live_`
- Environment: Production API
- Data: Real integration data
- Rate Limit: TBD
- Use for: Live applications

## Managing Keys

### View All Keys

The API Keys dashboard shows:
- Key name
- Key prefix (last 4 characters shown)
- Creation date
- Last used timestamp
- Request count
- Active status

### Revoke a Key

To revoke a key:
1. Find the key in your dashboard
2. Click "Revoke"
3. Confirm the action

Revoked keys:
- Stop working immediately
- Cannot be reactivated
- Generate a new key instead

### Rotate Keys

Recommended key rotation schedule:
- **Development**: Every 90 days
- **Production**: Every 30 days
- **After compromise**: Immediately

To rotate:
1. Generate a new key
2. Update your application
3. Test the new key
4. Revoke the old key

## Storage Best Practices

### Environment Variables

Store keys in `.env` files (never commit to git):

```bash
# .env
SALLY_API_KEY=sk_staging_abc123...
```

Add to `.gitignore`:
```
.env
.env.local
```

### Application Configuration

```javascript
// config.js
export const config = {
  sallyApiKey: process.env.SALLY_API_KEY,
  sallyApiUrl: 'https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1'
};
```

### CI/CD Secrets

Use your platform's secret management:

**GitHub Actions:**
```yaml
env:
  SALLY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SALLY_API_KEY }}
```

**Vercel:**
```bash
vercel env add SALLY_API_KEY
```

## Usage Monitoring

Track your API usage in the dashboard:

- **Request count** - Total requests made with this key
- **Last used** - Timestamp of most recent request
- **Rate limit status** - Remaining requests in current hour

Set up alerts for:
- Approaching rate limits
- Unusual activity patterns
- First use of a new key (verify it's you)

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Keys stored in environment variables
- [ ] `.env` files in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Staging keys for development only
- [ ] Production keys for production only
- [ ] Keys rotated regularly
- [ ] Revoked keys when team members leave
- [ ] Usage monitored for anomalies

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid or expired API key"

**Possible causes:**
- Key was revoked
- Key expired
- Typo in key
- Wrong environment (staging key on production endpoint)

**Solution:** Generate a new key

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Possible causes:**
- Too many requests in current hour
- Missing rate limit headers in retry logic

**Solution:**
- Wait for rate limit reset
- Implement exponential backoff
- Upgrade to higher tier (production)
