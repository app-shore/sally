# Recommend Rest Optimization

Get intelligent recommendations for optimal rest stop placement and duration.

## Interactive API Explorer

<ApiReference tag="Optimization" />

## Overview

The REST Optimization engine analyzes route conditions to recommend:

- **Rest type** - FULL_REST (10h), PARTIAL_REST (7h), or NO_REST
- **Rest location** - Optimal placement based on available hours
- **Rest duration** - Minimum required vs recommended
- **Dock time leverage** - Whether to count dock time as sleeper berth

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/rest/recommend \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_id": "DRV001",
    "hours_remaining": 180,
    "hours_needed": 360,
    "next_stop_type": "delivery",
    "dock_duration_minutes": 120
  }'
```

## Response Structure

```json
{
  "recommendation": "FULL_REST",
  "rest_duration_minutes": 600,
  "reasoning": "Driver has insufficient hours for remaining route. Full 10-hour rest required.",
  "alternatives": [
    {
      "type": "PARTIAL_REST",
      "duration_minutes": 420,
      "note": "7-hour rest + 2-hour dock time = 9 hours off-duty"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rest Types

### FULL_REST (10 hours)
- Required when driver needs complete reset
- Provides full 11-hour drive time
- Most common for overnight stops

### PARTIAL_REST (7-8 hours)
- Leverages dock time as sleeper berth
- Combines rest stop + delivery time
- Optimizes for time efficiency

### NO_REST
- Sufficient hours remain
- Continue with planned route
- No rest stop insertion needed
