# Find Fuel Stops

Find optimal fuel stop locations based on vehicle range, fuel prices, and route constraints.

## Interactive API Explorer

<ApiReference tag="Optimization" />

## Overview

The Fuel Stop Optimizer identifies the best locations to refuel based on:

- **Vehicle range** - Fuel capacity and current level
- **Fuel prices** - Real-time diesel prices along route
- **Route constraints** - HOS, delivery windows, driver preferences
- **Network access** - Preferred truck stop chains

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/fuel/find-stops \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "vehicle_id": "VEH001",
    "current_fuel_gallons": 50,
    "tank_capacity_gallons": 200,
    "fuel_efficiency_mpg": 6.5,
    "route_segments": [
      {
        "from": "Los Angeles, CA",
        "to": "Phoenix, AZ",
        "distance_miles": 380
      }
    ],
    "preferences": {
      "max_price_per_gallon": 4.50,
      "preferred_chains": ["Loves", "Pilot", "TA"]
    }
  }'
```

## Response Structure

```json
{
  "fuel_stops": [
    {
      "location": "Loves Travel Stop, Quartzsite, AZ",
      "coordinates": [33.6633, -114.2294],
      "distance_from_origin_miles": 200,
      "price_per_gallon": 3.89,
      "estimated_gallons": 75,
      "estimated_cost": 291.75
    }
  ],
  "total_fuel_cost": 291.75,
  "total_fuel_stops": 1
}
```

## Optimization Strategy

The fuel optimizer balances:

1. **Price** - Find lowest-cost fuel along route
2. **Range** - Ensure vehicle doesn't run out
3. **Convenience** - Minimize detours and delays
4. **Timing** - Coordinate with rest stops when possible
