# Acknowledge Alert

Mark an alert as acknowledged to indicate dispatcher is aware and taking action.

## Interactive API Explorer

<ApiReference tag="Alerts" />

## Overview

Acknowledging an alert:
- Stops the alert from re-triggering
- Records dispatcher who acknowledged
- Logs timestamp of acknowledgment
- Updates alert status to `acknowledged`

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/alerts/{alert_id}/acknowledge \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dispatcher_id": "DISP123",
    "notes": "Contacted driver, rerouting around traffic"
  }'
```

## When to Acknowledge

Acknowledge alerts when:
- You have reviewed the alert details
- You are actively working on resolution
- You want to prevent duplicate notifications
- You need to assign ownership
