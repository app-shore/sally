# Resolve Alert

Mark an alert as resolved after the underlying issue has been addressed.

## Interactive API Explorer

<ApiReference tag="Alerts" />

## Overview

Resolving an alert:
- Updates status to `resolved`
- Records resolution details
- Archives alert for reporting
- Stops monitoring for this specific trigger instance

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/alerts/{alert_id}/resolve \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dispatcher_id": "DISP123",
    "resolution": "Route updated, driver now on schedule",
    "action_taken": "reroute"
  }'
```

## Resolution Actions

Common resolution actions:
- `reroute` - Route was updated
- `contact_driver` - Communicated with driver
- `adjust_schedule` - Modified appointment times
- `no_action` - Alert resolved itself
- `escalated` - Forwarded to management
