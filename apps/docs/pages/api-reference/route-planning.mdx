## Interactive API Explorer

Test the Route Planning APIs directly in your browser. Enter your API key in the authentication section below.

<ApiReference tag="Route Planning" />

## Key Features

- **Stop Sequence Optimization** - TSP algorithm finds optimal stop order
- **HOS Validation** - Ensures route is compliant with FMCSA regulations
- **Automatic Rest Stops** - Inserts rest stops where driver runs out of hours
- **Fuel Stop Optimization** - Adds fuel stops based on range and price
- **Dynamic Updates** - Update routes when conditions change

## Example Use Cases

### Basic Route Planning

Plan a simple route from origin to destination:

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/routes/plan \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_id": "DRV001",
    "vehicle_id": "VEH001",
    "stops": [
      {
        "location": "Los Angeles, CA",
        "type": "origin"
      },
      {
        "location": "Phoenix, AZ",
        "type": "delivery"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### Multi-Stop Route

Optimize delivery sequence for multiple stops:

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/routes/plan \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "driver_id": "DRV001",
    "vehicle_id": "VEH001",
    "stops": [
      {"location": "Los Angeles, CA", "type": "origin"},
      {"location": "Phoenix, AZ", "type": "delivery"},
      {"location": "Tucson, AZ", "type": "delivery"},
      {"location": "El Paso, TX", "type": "destination"}
    ],
    "optimization_goal": "minimize_time"
  }'
```
