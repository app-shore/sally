# Update Route

Update existing routes based on real-time triggers and changing conditions.

## Interactive API Explorer

<ApiReference tag="Route Planning" />

## Overview

The Update Route API allows you to modify active routes when conditions change. This endpoint is typically called by the monitoring service when triggers are detected.

## Common Update Scenarios

- **Traffic delays** - Re-optimize route to avoid congestion
- **Weather conditions** - Reroute around severe weather
- **Driver status changes** - Update route based on HOS changes
- **Stop time changes** - Adjust for early/late arrivals
- **New stops added** - Insert additional deliveries

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://sally-api.apps.appshore.in/api/v1/routes/update \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_staging_YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "plan_id": "route_abc123",
    "trigger_type": "traffic_delay",
    "trigger_data": {
      "segment_id": "seg_456",
      "delay_minutes": 45
    }
  }'
```
