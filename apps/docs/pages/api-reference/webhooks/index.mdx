# Webhooks

Receive real-time notifications when important events occur on your routes.

## Overview

Webhooks allow you to subscribe to events and receive HTTP POST requests to your specified endpoint when those events occur. This enables real-time integration with your dispatch systems, TMS, or custom applications.

## Available Events

### Route Events
- `route.planned` - New route successfully planned
- `route.updated` - Route modified due to trigger
- `route.completed` - Route finished
- `route.cancelled` - Route cancelled by dispatcher

### Alert Events
- `alert.created` - New alert generated
- `alert.acknowledged` - Alert acknowledged by dispatcher
- `alert.resolved` - Alert resolved

### Driver Events
- `driver.arrived` - Driver arrived at stop
- `driver.departed` - Driver departed from stop
- `driver.rest_started` - Driver began rest period
- `driver.rest_completed` - Driver completed rest period

### HOS Events
- `hos.violation_risk` - HOS violation risk detected
- `hos.hours_low` - Driver hours running low
- `hos.rest_required` - Rest stop required soon

## Webhook Configuration

## Webhook Payload Structure

```json
{
  "event": "alert.created",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-05T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "alert_id": "alert_abc123",

    "type": "hos_violation_imminent",
    "message": "Driver will exceed hours in 30 minutes"
  }
}
```

## Security

All webhook requests include:
- **Signature header** - HMAC signature for verification
- **Timestamp** - Request timestamp to prevent replay attacks
- **API version** - Version identifier for payload structure

## Retry Policy

If your endpoint doesn't respond with 2xx status:
- Retry after 1 minute
- Retry after 5 minutes
- Retry after 15 minutes
- After 3 failed attempts, webhook is disabled
